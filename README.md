Computational Geometry
======================

This Github repository contains algorithms described in the book "Computational Geometry: Algorithms and Applications". The algorithms are written in JavaScript and the output is displayed with the HTML5 Canvas.

About the book
==============
Computational geometry emerged from the field of algorithms design and analysis in the late 1970s. It has grown into a recognized discipline with its own journals, conferences, and a large community of active researchers. The success of the field as a research discipline can on the one hand be explained from the beauty of the problems studied and the solutions obtained, and, on the other hand, by the many application domains---computer graphics, geographic information systems (GIS), robotics, and others---in which geometric algorithms play a fundamental role.

For many geometric problems the early algorithmic solutions were either slow or difficult to understand and implement. In recent years a number of new algorithmic techniques have been developed that improved and simplified many of the previous approaches. In this textbook we have tried to make these modern algorithmic solutions accessible to a large audience. The book has been written as a textbook for a course in computational geometry, but it can also be used for self study.
